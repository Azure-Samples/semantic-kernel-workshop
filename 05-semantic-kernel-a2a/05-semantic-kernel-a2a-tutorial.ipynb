        "## Summary and Key Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "Congratulations! You've successfully implemented Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication using Semantic Kernel. Here's what we accomplished:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 What We Built\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Flight Booking Agent**: A specialized agent that handles flight bookings\n",
        "2. **A2A Server**: Exposes the flight booking agent via HTTP API\n",
        "3. **Travel Planning Agent**: A general travel agent that uses the flight booking agent as a tool\n",
        "4. **A2A Communication**: Seamless communication between agents\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🔑 Key Concepts Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Agent Specialization**\n",
        "- Each agent has a specific purpose and set of capabilities\n",
        "- Specialization leads to better performance and maintainability\n",
        "- Agents can be developed and deployed independently\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **A2A Protocol**\n",
        "- Standardized way for agents to communicate\n",
        "- Includes agent cards, skill definitions, and message formats\n",
        "- Enables discovery and invocation of agent capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Tool Integration**\n",
        "- Agents can use other agents as tools\n",
        "- Semantic Kernel's function calling mechanism works with A2A\n",
        "- Allows for complex workflows and orchestration\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Context Management**\n",
        "- Each agent maintains its own conversation context\n",
        "- Context IDs ensure proper conversation tracking\n",
        "- Enables stateful interactions across agent boundaries\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🏗️ Architecture Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity**: Each agent can be developed, tested, and deployed separately\n",
        "2. **Scalability**: Agents can be scaled independently based on demand\n",
        "3. **Reusability**: Specialized agents can be used by multiple orchestrators\n",
        "4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "To extend this implementation, you could:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Add More Specialized Agents**: Hotel booking, car rental, restaurant recommendations\n",
        "2. **Implement Authentication**: Add security to agent communications\n",
        "3. **Add Monitoring**: Track agent performance and usage metrics\n",
        "4. **Deploy to Production**: Use container orchestration for scalability\n",
        "5. **Add More Tools**: Integrate with real booking APIs and services\n",
        "\n",
        "### 💡 Best Practices\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Design for Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have a clear, focused purpose\n",
        "2. **Use Descriptive Agent Cards**: Help other agents understand capabilities\n",
        "3. **Implement Error Handling**: Handle network failures and agent unavailability\n",
        "4. **Monitor Agent Health**: Ensure agents are responsive and functioning correctly\n",
        "5. **Version Your Agents**: Use semantic versioning for agent APIs\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial demonstrates the power of agent-to-agent communication in creating sophisticated, distributed AI systems. The modular approach allows for building complex workflows while maintaining clean, maintainable code.\"\n"
