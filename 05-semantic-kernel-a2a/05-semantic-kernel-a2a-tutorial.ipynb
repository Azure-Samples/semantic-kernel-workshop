        "- **Agent Card Fetching**: The system fetched the agent card to understand capabilities\n",
        "- **Message Routing**: The request was properly formatted and sent to the flight booking agent\n",

        "#### **Test 3: Follow-up Details**\n",

        "### 🔑 Key Concepts Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Agent Specialization**\n",
        "- Each agent has a specific purpose and set of capabilities\n",
        "- Specialization leads to better performance and maintainability\n",
        "- Agents can be developed and deployed independently\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **A2A Protocol**\n",
        "- Standardized way for agents to communicate\n",
        "- Includes agent cards, skill definitions, and message formats\n",
        "- Enables discovery and invocation of agent capabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Tool Integration**\n",
        "- Agents can use other agents as tools\n",
        "- Semantic Kernel's function calling mechanism works with A2A\n",
        "- Allows for complex workflows and orchestration\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Context Management**\n",
        "- Each agent maintains its own conversation context\n",
        "- Context IDs ensure proper conversation tracking\n",
        "- Enables stateful interactions across agent boundaries\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🏗️ Architecture Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity**: Each agent can be developed, tested, and deployed separately\n",
        "2. **Scalability**: Agents can be scaled independently based on demand\n",
        "3. **Reusability**: Specialized agents can be used by multiple orchestrators\n",
        "4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🚀 Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "To extend this implementation, you could:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Add More Specialized Agents**: Hotel booking, car rental, restaurant recommendations\n",
        "2. **Add More Tools**: Integrate with real booking APIs and services\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial demonstrates the power of agent-to-agent communication in creating sophisticated, distributed AI systems. The modular approach allows for building complex workflows while maintaining clean, maintainable code.\"\n"
